| CHANGELOG |
+-----------+


[ d2x v7 ]

- Refactored all modules and plugins in order to achieve code reuse through
  a new common library.
- Updated ciosmaps.xml to include the IRQ4 patch required by the new
  experimental EHCI module (not released yet).  
- Used a more proper offset to detect DL games like Sakura Wars.
- Disabled nand emulation before returning to system menu or channel.
- Improved error 002 fix after ios reload block. Now Wii Fit Plus channel
  installation works properly.
- Fixed missing identification and patch for base IOS60-v6174 in ES plugin.
- Added auto detection of the first FAT partition on the device when nand
  emulation is activated without specifying any partition.
- FAT Module moved a bit forward in memory in order to create the space
  required by the new experimental EHCI module (not released yet).
- Fixed a bug when closing FAT module.
- Fixed an alignement issue on file renaming in FFS plugin.
- Removed support for base IOSs with old version like IOS38 v3610.
- Added ios reload block capability for nand emulation.
- Removed FAT ISO loading support from DIP plugin (never used by any loader
  and completely useless now thanks to fraglist capability added in v6).
- Fixed a memory alignement issue that could break ios reload block.
- Added bidirectional escape for invalid FAT characters in nand emulation.
- Now FAT_GetUsage returns fake values for WiiWare/VirtualConsole and real 
  values taken from FAT for disc-based Wii games. This workaround has proven 
  to improve nand emulation compatibility. 
- Added a thread to make the drive led blink when writing to FAT.
- Minor changes and code clean up.


[ d2x v6 ]

- Added fraglist to support potentially any file system (tnx oggzee).
- Added support in fraglist for sector size up to 4K (typically required
  for hard drives greater than 2TB).
- Fixed a compatibility issue with libfat/libntfs in EHCI module.


[ d2x v5 ]

- Added USB/SD support for games affected by ios reload. Currently only WBFS
  partitions are supported (tnx WiiPower for your help).
- Fixed dual layer detection for games like Sakura Wars.
- Fixed GameCube audio streaming command for retail discs (tnx WiiPower).
- Added missing patches for base ios 53 and 55 in ES module. 
- Minor changes and code clean up.


[ d2x v4 ]

- Fixed error 002 in method 2 for blocking ios reload.
- Repeated ios reload are now supported by method 2.
- Added support to reload any ios, not only 249.
- Added "return to channel" feature compatible with all games out there.
- Fixed a bug in nand emulation to properly support HDD greater than 1TB.
- Added support for sector size up to 4KB (typically required for hard drives
  greater than 2TB).
- Removed file logging introduced in v3 since has proved harmful to games like
  LostWinds and LostWinds Winter of the Melodies.
- Updated FatFs to 0.8b. This allowed us to remove the workaround on file 
  renaming introduced in d2x v3.
- Fixed a potential buffer overflow while reading a directory.
- Fixed the error code returned by FAT_Readdir when the requested folder is
  an existing file (now all Strong Bad episodes are working properly).
- Fixed a bug in FAT_GetStats (now games like Max & the Magic Marker,
  FFCC My Life as a King and FFCC My Life as a Darklord are working properly).
- Fixed a bug in FAT_Seek to prevent from increasing the file size when seeking
  out of the file.
- Fixed the length of the output buffer in FAT_ReadDir.
- Changed timing logic in FAT module.
- Minor changes and code clean up.

  NOTE:
  Currently ios reload block improvements are only relevant to disc loading!!!
  Blocking ios reload for usb loaders will be investigated in future releases.


[ d2x v3 ]

- Fixed a bug in nand usage causing save creation failure in WiiWare games
  like Tetris Party, FFCC My Life as a King and Brain Challenge.
- Fixed the deletion of folder /tmp on nand emulation start up.
- Added a workaround to fix a bug on file renaming causing the failure on 
  the 2nd save in games like The Will of Dr.Frankenstein.

  for backward compatibility).
- Implemented logging system to make debugging easier.
- Fixed a bug causing the message "corrupted data" in The Tower of Druaga.
- Fixed a bug causing stall in LIT.
- Other minor changes and code clean up.

- Fixed secondary USB port lag.


[ d2x v1 ]

- Fixed wiimote lag issue by restoring timing logic from cIOSX rev19.
- Fixed wiimote synch delay on WiiFlow start up by changing initial period 
  in timer creation.
- Fixed os_restart_timer with the correct number of arguments.
